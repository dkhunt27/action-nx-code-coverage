# action-nx-code-coverage

This is a github action for combining/compiling code coverage from an nx monorepo (although will probably work for other mono/single repos).

- This will loop through the coverage folder which should contain all the projects and their coverage results.
- On a PR execution, this will update the PR with a PR Commit displaying the coverage results for those projects
- On a push execution, this will update coverage badges for all projects (using the gist method specified [here](https://dev.to/thejaredwilcurt/coverage-badge-with-github-actions-finally-59fa)

> [GitHub Action](https://help.github.com/en/actions) to combine/compile code coverage from an nx monorepo

- ✅ &nbsp;Code coverage comment for monorepo
- ✅ &nbsp;Code coverage diff if base provided
- ✅ &nbsp;Updates the Code coverage comment instead of adding new

The report is based on the coverage report generated by your test runner.

## Setup

- Perform gist setup from [link](https://dev.to/thejaredwilcurt/coverage-badge-with-github-actions-finally-59fa)
- Must run nx:affected test --coverage so the coverage results already exist
  
```yaml
      - name: Comment Code Coverage on PR
        uses: dkhunt27/nx-code-coverage@v2
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          no-coverage-ran: false
          coverage-folder: ./coverage
          coverage-base-folder: ./coverage-base
          gist-processing: true
          gist-token: ${{ secrets.COVERAGE_BADGES_GIST_TOKEN }}
          gist-id: d7e6b443a01eba615fd2a7c1215aec91
          color: green
          named-logo: jest
          hide-coverage-reports: false
          hide-unchanged: false
```

## Making changes and pushing releases

- make new branch and make changes
- `npm run all`
- `git commit/push changes`
- make PR back to main
- wait for pipelines to finish; then merge
- `git checkout main`
- `git pull`
- `git tag v1`
- `SKIP_HOOKS=true git push origin v1`
- in github, edit tag and save (this will push to marketplace)

## NPM Check

```bash
npm run npm:check
```
